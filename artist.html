	<div class = "bodytext_7">
	<ul><li>love video games as much as we do</li>
	<li>are willing to relocate to where we are based for the coming summer</li>
	<li>can use a broad range of tools: Photoshop, Maya, 3DS Max, Mudbox, Unity 3D, 
	Adobe Illustrator, pen and paper, Z-Brush, etc.</li>
	<li>can work with many different styles: cartoon, fine art, graphic art, 
	architectural models, logo design etc. TeemPlay needs to have a style all of its own. 
	Keep in mind we are a platform not an indie game… you may love oriental art but that 
	could be a turn off to someone who wants to build space ships in NU.</li>

	<div class = "headline_7"><h2><em>Some things you might find yourself doing as an 
	artist on the team include:</em></h2></div>
	<div class = "bodytext_7">
	<ul><li>Participate in weekly team meetings and specific project meetings</li>
	<li>Helping us build the TeemPlay brand which should be consistent and permeate 
	through everything we produce</li>
	<li>Designing the first round of objects, models, textures, etc which 
	players can buy in the game</li>
	<li>Creating 2D work (splash screens, log in background art, website assets) as well as 3D work 
	(character designs, buildings, unique level components)</li>
	<li>Creating assets upon other team member’s request. For example, Steve is making 
	a new promotional video for the newsletter and needs some original 2D presentation 
	components or Becket is working on a new ad and he needs some concept work for a 
	character from NU.</li>
	</ul></div></div>
	<div class = "description_7">
	<div class = "headline_7"><h2><em>Requirements:</em></h2></div>
	<div class = "bodytext_7">
	Art is a process. We understand that. As a result we will rarely if ever have any 
	drop-dead lines. In addition, we usually let artists set their own deadlines. 
	However, keep in mind, that your compensation at the end of the day will be a 
	reflection of the value you contribute to TeemPlay. Also keep in mind that even 
	with lose deadlines it is expected and required that the deadlines you set are 
	realistic and achievable. If you say it will take two weeks to finish the concept 
	work for a character design you should be done in two weeks or you should have told 
	the people working on the project with you the minute you realize your initial 
	estimate was incorrect. Everyone makes mistakes but you are expected to learn as 
	you go and get better at predicting your own deadlines.
	<ul><li>So the requirement here is that you are professional, honest with yourself and 
	what you can accomplish in what timeframe, able to learn from mistakes, and not 
	afraid to speak up when you are getting behind on a deadline.</li></ul>
